## terracanary util aws ecs run

Run an ECS task and wait for success

### Synopsis

Runs a single ECS task that is expected to end, and watches for a successful exit code. Note that an ECS task definition can contain multiple containers, so you must specify the container name that will receive the specified command (overriding its normal docker CMD). If a log group is specified, logs for the task will be output in not-quite-realtime.

If the task runs, but provides a non-0 exit code, terracanary will pass through the task exit code; if you need to respond to specific task exit codes, make sure they don't overlap terracanary exit codes (see canarrors/errors.go).'

```
