## terracanary util aws ecs wait

Wait for an ECS cluster to reach a stable state

### Synopsis

Waits for an ECS cluster to reach an expected state.

If a number of instances is specified, wait until the cluster has that many instances joined to it.

If a service is specified, wait for it to reach the expected final state based upon its current configuration. This means:

* Task count of current task revision == desired tasks
* Task count of other task revisions == 0
* The instances backing the running tasks are in service with the service load balancer, if any
