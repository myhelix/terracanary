## terracanary test

Check if there are any changes to a stack

### Synopsis

Uses "terraform plan" to check if any changes are needed for the specified stack. To get accurate results, be sure to include the exact arguments you would specify to "terracanary apply" (e.g. input stacks).

Exit Codes:
	 0 - Success; plan succeeded with no changes
	15 - Plan succeeded, but had changes
	 * - Plan failed due to terraform or other errors
