## terracanary args

Set args that will be passed to terraform for plan/apply/destroy

### Synopsis

This persistently configures terracanary to pass a set of arbitrary arguments through to terraform when running commands that require input variables (plan, apply, destroy). It should be run after 'terracanary init' but before any other terracanary commands; see the init help for a complete example.

```
terracanary args -- <terraform-flags>...
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for args
```
